            <h2>Don't just keep it to yourself!</h2><br>
            <p>
                As well as keeping a GIT repository on your own computer, it is essential to create an account on GITHub, and upload your work. Not only does this allow you to publish it and get it online, but also invite collaborators to work on your project with you, as well as access your project from just about anywhere!
            </p><br>
            <h2>Will collaborators not interfere with my work?</h2><br>
            <p>
                Nonsense! When you work with collaborators, you should each work on seperate branches so you do not mess each other up, and merge branches at appropriate times. If it's your project, you can choose who can access it and who can commit changes!
