            <h2>What is GIT?</h2>
            <p>
                GIT is a Version Control System (VCS) that is used to keep track of any changes made to any particular project over time. It is a very versatile tool, as it allows the user to code without the fear of messing everything up. It acts not only as a 'save game' function, but also as a collaborative tool, allowing different users to work on different 'branches' of a given project at the same time, without them interfearing with each other.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Why GIT?</h2>
            <p>
                GIT is the most popular VCS among programmers; most job descriptions will mention familiarity with GIT. This is for multiple reasons.

                GIT is supported by all operating systems, and almost all IDEs and environments, most of which have specific add ons to facilitate the use of GIT. Another reason is that GIT is a distributed VCS, as opposed to a live server VCS, which evades the problem of the server going down and everyone having to stop what they're doing.
